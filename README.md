## My process

### Tech Stack

HTML, CSS(SCSS), Vanilla JavaScript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS(variables, nesting)
- CSS Flxbox
- Desktop-first approach
- Vanilla JavaScript for generation some sections through the DOM

### What I learned

I used simple JavaScript to create the slider carousel and an array of objects to render sections of the page with DOM. Instead of using CSS, I learned that JavaScript can also be used for toggling, for example, the navigation hamburger menu.
